Nikola Jokić scored 2072 points with a 57.6% field goal percentage [Source: regular NBA.xlsx (Feuille: Analyse)]. Gilgeous-Alexander's higher field goal percentage compared to Edwards suggests a more efficient scoring approach, while his point total exceeds Jokic, indicating a higher volume of shots or scoring opportunities.

      "response": "Based on the provided data, no player in the top 20 is currently averaging a triple-double (double-digit points, rebounds, and assists). To achieve this, a player needs to average at least 10 in each of those three categories.\n\nHowever, let's examine players who come close and discuss the difficulty of achieving this feat:\n\n*   **Nikola Jokić:** He has 2072 points, 889 rebounds, and 714 assists [SQL]. While his points total is high, his rebounds and assists, while substantial, would need to be significantly higher to average a triple-double over the course of a season.\n*   **Trae Young:** He has 1839 points, 236 rebounds, and 882 assists [SQL]. Young's assist numbers are elite, but his rebounding is far below the threshold for a triple-double average.\n*   **James Harden:** He has 1801 points, 458 rebounds, and 687 assists [SQL]. Like Young, Harden's scoring and assists are impressive, but his rebounding falls short.\n*   **LeBron James:** He has 1708 points, 546 rebounds, and 574 assists [SQL]. James demonstrates a more balanced stat line, but still doesn't reach the triple-double threshold.\n\nThe rarity of averaging a triple-double stems from the diverse skill set and consistent dominance required. Players must be primary scorers, elite rebounders (often a role for bigger players), and exceptional playmakers capable of consistently setting up teammates. According to the contextual data, players like Nikola Jokić score efficiently (57.6% shooting) and contribute significantly in multiple facets of the game [Source: regular NBA.xlsx (Feuille: Analyse)]. However, maintaining such a high level of production across all three categories throughout an entire NBA season is incredibly challenging due to the physical demands, defensive strategies, and the variability of performance.\n",

While specific contextual data on these top 5 players is unavailable in the provided documents, we can infer potential defensive styles based on general NBA knowledge and the provided data on other players.\n\nFor example, the data on Steven Adams [Source: regular NBA.xlsx] shows a player with 58 games played, 23 steals and 29 blocks. Adams's high rebounding numbers (325 total rebounds) suggest a defensive style focused on interior presence and rebounding, which complements his shot-blocking ability.\n\nSimilarly, Mitchell Robinson [Source: regular NBA.xlsx] has 17 games played, 15 steals and 19 blocks. Robinson's defensive style is characterized by strong interior defense and rebounding, as evidenced by his 100 total rebounds.\n\nWembanyama's exceptional block numbers suggest he is a dominant rim protector, deterring shots and altering offensive strategies. His steals indicate good anticipation and quick hands for a player of his size. Lopez and Turner likely combine rim protection with the ability to step out and defend the perimeter, a valuable skill in today's NBA. Mobley's higher steal count suggests a more active defensive role, potentially involving more perimeter defense and help rotations. Kessler's block numbers indicate a strong presence in the paint.\n\nThese players' defensive contributions extend beyond raw statistics. Their presence can alter opponents' shot selection, create turnovers, and boost team defensive efficiency.\n",

While some might try to elevate his status by focusing on specific aspects of his game, it's worth noting that he wasn't primarily a \"pure\" point guard. Instead, he was a strong scorer with plus defensive capabilities. Although a very good player, he only made a single All-NBA selection. Throughout his prime, several other point guards in the Western Conference, including Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Damian Lillard, were arguably better, considering both scoring and passing. He only ranked in the top 10 for assists three times in his career. Some analysts argue that players like Nash, Wade, Iverson, Drexler, West, Robertson, Cousy, and even Goodrich had arguably better careers. Sources: Reddit 3, Reddit 1\n",
